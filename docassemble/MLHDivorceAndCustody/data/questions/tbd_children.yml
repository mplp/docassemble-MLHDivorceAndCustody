You can do this by returning to this tool and changing your answer to the question above that asks if parentage was revoked, and then re-downloading the Judgment of Divorce form.

  You, your spouse, or the child's other biological parent can file a motion as part of your divorce case asking the judge to revoke (undo) your legal parentage. To prepare this motion, use the [Do-It-Yourself Revoke Parentage Established by Marriage tool](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/family/do-it-yourself-revoke-parentage-established-marriage). You will need to start the divorce case before you can file the parentage motion.

  If nobody files a Motion to Determine Child Born Out of Wedlock, you will remain a legal parent. This means the judge can award you custody and/or parenting time, and you may be responsible for paying child support. A motion to revoke parentage can also be filed after your divorce is final, but the judge may be less likely to grant the motion when the child is older.

  If the judge revokes your spouse's parentage before your divorce is final, you will need to update the Judgment of Divorce before presenting it to the judge. You can do this by returning to this tool and changing your answer to the question above that asks if parentage was revoked, and then re-downloading the Judgment of Divorce form.

  You, your spouse, or the child's other biological parent can file a motion as part of your divorce case asking the judge to revoke (undo) your spouse's legal parentage. To prepare this motion, use the [Do-It-Yourself Revoke Parentage Established by Marriage tool](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/family/do-it-yourself-revoke-parentage-established-marriage). You will need to start the divorce case before you can file the parentage motion.

  If nobody files a Motion to Determine Child Born Out of Wedlock, your spouse will remain a legal parent. This means the judge can award them custody and/or parenting time, and they may be responsible for paying child support. A motion to revoke parentage can also be filed after your divorce is final, but the judge may be less likely to grant the motion when the child is older.
