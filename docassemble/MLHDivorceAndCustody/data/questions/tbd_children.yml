  More info about minor children and divorce
content: |
  If you and your spouse have any **minor children together**, your divorce must address custody, parenting time, and child support. 

  **Minor children of just one spouse** must also be listed in the divorce paperwork. However, the divorce will not cover their custody, parenting time, or child support.

  More info about children who are 18 to 19-and-a-half years old
content: |
  If you and your spouse have a **child between 18 years old and 19 years and 6 months**, it is possible to ask the court for child support if:

  * The child is enrolled full time in high school,
  * You reasonably expect the child to graduate, **and**
  * The child lives with one parent full time.

  If all of these things are true and you ask for child support, the judge **may** grant the request. It is not a guarantee. This can be complicated. If you want to ask for child support in this situation, you may want to talk to a lawyer. ${MLH_GUIDE_FULL} 
  
  You can make your divorce forms using this tool, but the forms **will not** include a child support request for your adult child.

subject: What is a "home state" and why does it matter?
content: |
  Usually, a Michigan court can enter an order about child custody when Michigan is the “home state” of a child. This matters in a divorce case because the final order in the case will include custody.

  The home state of a child is the state where the child has lived with a parent (or a person acting as a parent) for at least 6 consecutive months (6 months in a row). If the child is less than 6 months old, the home state is the state where the child lived from birth with a parent or person acting as a parent. A short-term absence of a parent is included as part of the 6 months.

  We ask where ${ children[i].familiar() } lived to find out if a Michigan court can issue a custody order.
---
template: home_state_trip_info
subject: What if ${ children[i].familiar() } went on a trip?
content: |
  % if children[i].age_in_months() >= 6:
  A short absence is still part of the six consecutive months. 
  
  For example:
  
  * A child may have lived with you in Michigan for four months.
  * Then you both go to visit relatives in Ohio for a week. 
  * Then, you return to Michigan with the child, where you live for two more months. 
  * Then you file your divorce case.
  
  In this case, the week in Ohio counts as part of the time the child lived in Michigan. The child in the example has lived in Michigan for the last six months.
  % else:
  A short absence is OK. 
  
  For example:
  
  * A child might be born and live with you in Michigan for two months. 
  * Then you both go to visit relatives in Ohio for a week. 
  * Then, you return to Michigan with the child, where you live for another month. 
  * Then you file your divorce case. 
  
  In this case, the week in Ohio counts as part of the time the child lived in Michigan. The child in the example has lived in Michigan from birth.

subquestion: |
  Based on your answers, Michigan is not ${ children[i] }'s legal "home state". 
  
  When another state, country, or Native American tribe is considered the child’s home state, a judge in a Michigan court may not be able to enter an order dealing with child custody, parenting time, and child support. This means that you may need to file in a separate court to get an order dealing with those issues.

  It is important for you to talk to a lawyer if you file for divorce in a Michigan court. There are some legal exceptions that could allow a Michigan court to enter an order about your minor child, but this is complicated.

subject: |
  What do these questions mean?
terms:
  noncustodial parent: |
    The "**noncustodial parent**" is the parent who does **not** have sole or primary physical custody of the children. 
    
    The "custodial parent" generally refers to the parent with whom the children live most of the time.
  
content: |
  ===== **Legal Custody** =====
  
  Having legal custody of your children means having the right to make important decisions about their lives, like where they go to school, what religion they are, and major medical decisions. Either parent can have sole legal custody, or parents can have joint legal custody. 
  
  When parents have joint legal custody, they both have the right to weigh in on important decisions about their kids. Both parents must agree on important decisions. If they can’t agree, they may have to ask the judge to decide. 
  
  If a parent has sole legal custody, that parent can make these important decisions without the other parent’s agreement.

  ===== **Physical Custody** =====
  
  Having physical custody of your children means your children will live with you at least some of the time. Either parent can have sole physical custody, or parents can have joint physical custody. 
  
  When parents have joint physical custody, the children take turns living with each parent. 
  
  If one parent has sole physical custody, the other parent will usually have regular parenting time, or “visitation,” with the children.

  ===== **Parenting Time Types** =====
  
  **Reasonable**: If a judge orders “reasonable” parenting time, specific dates, times, and other conditions are left for the parents to work out. If you believe that you and your spouse can agree on parenting time arrangements, you may ask for reasonable parenting time rather than a specific parenting time schedule. However, if the judge orders reasonable parenting time, and you and your spouse can’t agree, the judge may not be able to enforce the order or judgment. You will need to return to court and ask for a specific parenting time schedule in order for the judge to enforce the judgment.

  **Specific**: If a judge orders “specific” parenting time, all of the dates, times, and conditions for visits are included in the court order. Many counties have standard parenting time schedules that you can use in your case. You can contact the Friend of the Court in the county where your case will be filed and ask if there is a standard parenting time schedule. You can also choose one of our common parenting time schedules for families that have joint physical custody, for families with school-age children, for families with children younger than school age, or for long distance parenting time of school-age children.

  **Specific and supervised**: If a judge orders “specific and supervised” parenting time, all of the dates, times, and conditions for visits are included in the court order. The judge will order parenting time to be supervised by a third party – such as a relative, friend, or supervised parenting time center. Supervised parenting time may be appropriate if the {noncustodial parent} is a risk to the children. The supervisor must be willing to supervise parenting time.

id: Hague Convention warning
continue button field: hague_convention_info
question: Parenting Time in a Foreign Country and the Hague Convention
subquestion: |
  The Hague Convention is a treaty that helps parents get a kidnapped child back from other countries that have agreed to the treaty. [Countries that are treaty partners](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/abductions/hague-abduction-country-list.html) have agreed to return a child who has been taken to or kept in another Hague country in violation of a parent's custodial rights.

  An abducted child is returned to where the child was a **habitual resident.** This means the country where the child has been living. It doesn’t necessarily mean the country where the child or the child’s parents are citizens. After the child is returned to the country of habitual residence, custody decisions are made in the courts there. The Hague Convention does not decide who should have custody of the child. It only decides where the custody case will happen.

  It can be much harder to return a kidnapped child from a country that has not signed on to the Hague Convention. Because of this, Michigan law requires your Judgment of Divorce to include a paragraph that prevents parenting time in a non-Hague Convention country. The Judgment includes a place where you and your spouse can agree to allow parenting time in a specific country that is not a Hague Convention country, but you cannot do this using this tool.

  The Hague Convention is complicated, and it is an important tool for a parent whose spouse abducts their child and keeps the child in another country. If you want your spouse to have parenting time in a country that is **not** a party to the Hague Convention, you may want to consider talking to a lawyer to make sure you understand the risks involved.

question: Domicile and Residence of Minor Children 
subquestion: |
  If your Judgment of Divorce has custody provisions, the following will apply:

  % if len(children.complete_elements()) > 1:
  * If you have sole or joint physical custody of your children and you move, you must give the Friend of the Court the child’s new address in writing.
  * The minor children may not be moved from the state of Michigan without the judge’s prior approval. Even if you and your spouse agree that the children can move out of state, you must get a court order first.
  * Neither you nor your spouse may move more than 100 miles away from where you lived at the beginning of the case (within Michigan) except in certain situations. This is called the “100-mile rule.” **If one parent is granted sole legal custody of the minor children, the 100-mile rule will not apply.**
  % else:
  * If you have sole or joint physical custody of your child and you move, you must give the Friend of the Court the child’s new address in writing.
  * The minor child may not be moved from the state of Michigan without the judge’s prior approval. Even if you and your spouse agree that the child can move out of state, you must get a court order first.
  * Neither you nor your spouse may move more than 100 miles away from where you lived at the beginning of the case (within Michigan) except in certain situations.

question: Child Support
subquestion: |
  % if tool_ID == "divorce_complaint":
  Your Complaint for Divorce will ask the judge to order child support. 
  % endif
  Michigan law requires judges to order child support based on the Michigan Child Support Formula. In many counties, the Friend of the Court will calculate child support for you. The amount of child support is based on the income of each parent, the number of overnights that each parent has with the child, and a number of other factors. You can use the [MiChildSupport Calculator](https://micase.state.mi.us/calculatorapp/public/welcome/load.html) on the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services website to find out what the support amount might be in your case.

  In some situations, the judge can order support that is less than what is required by the Michigan Child Support Formula, or order no child support at all—but this is uncommon. If you think there is a reason to have less child support than required by the Formula or none at all, you may want to contact a lawyer. ${MLH_GUIDE_FULL}

  - Do you get public assistance that is **based on having low income**?: pa_received

# not done need to know whether to standardize with fee waiver tool or not, this question probable needs to be separate because we need the neither, applied, etc. options. But maybe list can be shared?
# note divorce tool currently only asks for SSI case number if there is no MDHHS case number. (And in that case prints a PII form.) Fee waiver tool only uses SSI case number if there's no MDHHS and no "Other" case number. So probably should follow same logic here. 
# note, if they choose "applied, but not receiving", only ask for specific type of aid if there are children or possibly if they're asking for spousal support. (Note that for complaint we do ask the income questions even if there's no kids or spousal support.)

subquestion: |
  Under federal tax law, the parent who a child lives with for the greater number of nights during the year is entitled to claim tax deductions, credits, and exemptions for that child. This includes state, federal, and local deductions, credits, and exemptions.

  Even though the parent with the greater number of overnights is entitled to claim the child, you and your spouse may agree to something different. For example, even if you will have more parenting time overnights, you may agree that your spouse can claim your child for tax purposes in exchange for something you want in your property settlement.

  More info about giving tax benefits based on the actual number overnights (the first option)
content: |
  Choosing this option can have a  different effect than specifically giving the tax deductions, credits, and exemptions to the parent who has the greater number of parenting time overnights based on the Judgment of Divorce. 
  
  If the parties do not follow their Judgment of Divorce, and the parent who was supposed to have more overnights ends up having less than 50% of the overnights in one year, then this provision would allow the parent who **actually had over 50% of the overnights** to claim the tax credits, etc., **instead of the parent who was awarded more overnights.**)
