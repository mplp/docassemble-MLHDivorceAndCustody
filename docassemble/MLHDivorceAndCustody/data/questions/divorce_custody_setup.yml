terms:
  - phrases:
      - assisted reproduction
    definition: |
      Assisted reproduction is a way to become pregnant that is not sexual intercourse. It includes:

      * Donor insemination
      * Sperm or egg donation
      * Embryo donation
      * In vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer
      * Intracytoplasmic sperm injection
      * Assisted reproductive technology
  - phrases:
      - parenting time
    definition: |
      Sometimes called "visitation".
  - phrases:
      - minor
    definition: |
      A child is a minor if they are 17 years old or younger.
  - investments: |
      Stocks, bonds, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), mutual funds, Money Market Accounts, or other investments, not including pensions or retirement accounts.
  - vehicles_make: |
      Make refers to the name of the company that manufactured the vehicle. Examples of vehicle "makes" are Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, and Toyota.
  - vehicles_model: |
      Model refers to the type of car. Examples of "models" are Focus, Cutlass, Town and Country, and Highlander.
  - divided: |
      Something has already been divided if:
      
      * you and your spouse **agree** who should have it, and
      * it is **already in the possession** of the agreed person.

      If something has already been divided, you do not need to add it here.
  - stayed: |
      Most cases are not stayed. A stay is a court ruling to stop or pause a court case. A court can lift the stay later and continue the case.
      
      Examples: Sometimes when a party files an appeal, a judge may grant a motion for a stay. When this happens, it stops the effect of the lower court order while the appeal is going on. Sometimes a stay happens without an appeal. For example, a bankruptcy case usually stays the division of marital property in a divorce case.
