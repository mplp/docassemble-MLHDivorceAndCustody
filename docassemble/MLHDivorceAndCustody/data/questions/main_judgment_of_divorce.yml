  Marriage breakdown
subquestion: |
  Michigan law requires you to testify that there has been a breakdown of the marriage to the extent that the objects of matrimony have been destroyed and there remains no reasonable likelihood that your marriage can be preserved. This means that there has been a serious, permanent, marital breakdown. It means it is very unlikely that you and your spouse can work things out.

  Spousal support

    datatype: yesnoradio
  - note: |
      WARNING! This tool cannot help you ask for spousal support. A spousal request must be made in either the Complaint for Divorce or Counterclaim for Divorce. Asking for spousal support is complicated, and the form produced by this tool cannot do that. If you want to ask for spousal support, find a lawyer to help you. To get lawyer referral information, use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) section of the Michigan Legal Help website.

      If you and your spouse agree that one of you will pay spousal support, or if the judge orders spousal support in your case, you can indicate that in the spousal support paragraph of the Judgment of Divorce that you will get from this tool, and fill out a [Uniform Spousal Support Order](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/4a7e2f/siteassets/forms/scao-approved/foc10b.pdf) to attach.

      WARNING! If you don't ask for spousal support now, you will not be allowed to come back to court later and ask for it. If you are unsure whether you might want or need spousal support in the future, you should request it now to preserve your right to ask for it later.

  Pension and/or retirement accounts
subquestion: |
  You may have a right to part of your spouse's pension or retirement account, and your spouse may have a right to part of yours. This is an important decision that can impact your future. Sometimes it is hard to know the full value of a pension or retirement account, especially if an account includes future benefits. If you don't know all the details of each person's pension and retirement accounts, you may want to consider talking to a lawyer before you decide how you want to divide them.

  Pension and/or retirement accounts
subquestion: |
  WARNING! This tool may not be right for you. Dividing pensions or retirement accounts is not simple. Neither this tool nor the Michigan Legal Help website will divide your pensions or retirement accounts. You can still complete this tool to prepare your Judgment of Divorce. The Judgment of Divorce produced after this tool will state that you have pensions or retirement accounts to divide, but the Judgment of Divorce will not divide them. You may want to consider hiring a lawyer to ask the judge to divide your pensions or retirement accounts. A lawyer can also draft the special order that is required.

  If you want to hire a lawyer to help you divide your pensions or retirement accounts and finish your case, you can find referral information in the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) section of the Michigan Legal Help website.

  Financial instruments
subquestion: |
  WARNING! This tool may not be right for you. Investments held in both spouses' names must be divided as part of your Judgment of Divorce. There may also be problems actually dividing these assets up after the Judgment is final. Dividing investments is not simple. You cannot use this tool or the Michigan Legal Help website to do this.

  You may want to consider hiring a lawyer to help you divide your investments. Consider asking a financial planner for advice on how to transfer investments and about tax issues that come with transferring investments. You can still complete this tool to prepare your Judgment of Divorce. You will be allowed to divide your investments in your Judgment of Divorce. However, the Judgment of Divorce will not include any information about how the investments will be transferred or about tax liability. Your investments will not be transferred automatically to the person they are awarded to in the Judgment of Divorce. There are more steps that need to be followed after the Judgment of Divorce is final.

  If you want to hire a lawyer to help you divide your investments and finish your case, you can find referral information in the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) section of the Michigan Legal Help website.
