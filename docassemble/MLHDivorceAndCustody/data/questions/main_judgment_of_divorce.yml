question: |
  Marriage breakdown
subquestion: |
  Michigan law requires you to testify that there has been a breakdown of the marriage to the extent that the objects of matrimony have been destroyed and there remains no reasonable likelihood that your marriage can be preserved. This means that there has been a serious, permanent, marital breakdown. It means it is very unlikely that you and your spouse can work things out.

  - note: |
      WARNING! This tool cannot help you ask for spousal support. A spousal request must be made in either the Complaint for Divorce or Counterclaim for Divorce. Asking for spousal support is complicated, and the form produced by this tool cannot do that. If you want to ask for spousal support, find a lawyer to help you. To get lawyer referral information, use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) section of the Michigan Legal Help website.

      If you and your spouse agree that one of you will pay spousal support, or if the judge orders spousal support in your case, you can indicate that in the spousal support paragraph of the Judgment of Divorce that you will get from this tool, and fill out a [Uniform Spousal Support Order](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/4a7e2f/siteassets/forms/scao-approved/foc10b.pdf) to attach.

      variable: marriage.request_spousal_support

      WARNING! If you don't ask for spousal support now, you will not be allowed to come back to court later and ask for it. If you are unsure whether you might want or need spousal support in the future, you should request it now to preserve your right to ask for it later.

subquestion: |
  You may have a right to part of your spouse's pension or retirement account, and your spouse may have a right to part of yours. This is an important decision that can impact your future. Sometimes it is hard to know the full value of a pension or retirement account, especially if an account includes future benefits. If you don't know all the details of each person's pension and retirement accounts, you may want to consider talking to a lawyer before you decide how you want to divide them.

subquestion: |
  WARNING! This tool may not be right for you. Dividing pensions or retirement accounts is not simple. Neither this tool nor the Michigan Legal Help website will divide your pensions or retirement accounts. You can still complete this tool to prepare your Judgment of Divorce. The Judgment of Divorce produced after this tool will state that you have pensions or retirement accounts to divide, but the Judgment of Divorce will not divide them. You may want to consider hiring a lawyer to ask the judge to divide your pensions or retirement accounts. A lawyer can also draft the special order that is required.

  If you want to hire a lawyer to help you divide your pensions or retirement accounts and finish your case, you can find referral information in the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) section of the Michigan Legal Help website.

  Financial investments
subquestion: |
  WARNING! This tool may not be right for you. Investments held in both spouses' names must be divided as part of your Judgment of Divorce. There may also be problems actually dividing these assets up after the Judgment is final. Dividing investments is not simple. You cannot use this tool or the Michigan Legal Help website to do this.

  You may want to consider hiring a lawyer to help you divide your investments. Consider asking a financial planner for advice on how to transfer investments and about tax issues that come with transferring investments. You can still complete this tool to prepare your Judgment of Divorce. You will be allowed to divide your investments in your Judgment of Divorce. However, the Judgment of Divorce will not include any information about how the investments will be transferred or about tax liability. Your investments will not be transferred automatically to the person they are awarded to in the Judgment of Divorce. There are more steps that need to be followed after the Judgment of Divorce is final.

  If you want to hire a lawyer to help you divide your investments and finish your case, you can find referral information in the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) section of the Michigan Legal Help website.

  Domestic violence
subquestion: |
  Domestic violence is serious and can impact many issues in your divorce. Domestic violence is often at its worst when a relationship ends. It is important for you to take steps to be as safe as possible. If there has been verbal, emotional, or physical abuse in your marriage, you may want to consider hiring a lawyer. Your local legal aid office or local domestic violence service provider may be able to help you. To learn more about domestic violence and to find contact information for helpful organizations, please see the [Domestic Violence and Divorce Resource pages](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/personal-safety). If you want to hire a lawyer, you can find referral information in the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) section of the Michigan Legal Help website.

  Contact information confidentiality
subquestion: |
  All of the information that you enter in this tool, including your address and telephone information, will be included on forms that you file with the court and give to your spouse. If you fear for your safety if this information is known by your spouse or someone else, proceed with caution. **Do not use an address or telephone number that you want to keep confidential in this tool or on your court forms.**

  Keep in mind that your divorce file is a public record and anyone could ask to look at it and see your address. To keep your address confidential, you need to have one of the following:

  - A Personal Protection Order or other order which keeps your address confidential, OR

  - You need to state that you and/or your children's safety would be at risk if you disclose your address. This is done by filing a Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act Affidavit with the court.

  Help!

  If you intend to keep your address confidential, give a different mailing address (such as a P.O. Box or the address of a friend or relative) and different telephone number (such as the telephone number of a friend or relative), where the court and your spouse can contact you regarding your case.

  Be aware that if your address is included on the papers that your spouse already filed, it is not confidential. Also, please be aware that some of your divorce forms will be incomplete if you do not supply your home address and/or the home address of your children. The court may require you to provide this information at some point during or after your case.

  If you fear for the safety of you or your children if your address is known by your spouse or someone else, it is strongly recommended that you hire a lawyer and do not do your divorce on your own. Your local domestic violence agency may also be able to help you. To learn more about domestic violence and to find contact information for helpful organizations, please see the [Domestic Violence and Divorce Resource pages](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/personal-safety). You can also use the [Guide to Legal Help](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/guide-to-legal-help) to look for a lawyer or legal services near you.

  Health coverage
subquestion: |
  **COBRA**: After your divorce is final, one spouse may continue getting coverage under the other spouse's insurance through COBRA. Your Judgment of Divorce will include language about this. Typically, the spouse who gets continuing medical insurance through COBRA must pay for it. Insurance through COBRA may cost more than when that person was covered as a spouse. If the parties agree to something else, like having the other spouse pay for the COBRA coverage, that must be specifically added to the Judgment of Divorce. You can add this in the Other Provisions section. The Other Provisions section will be available at the end of this tool.

question: |
  Personal property
subquestion: |
  You are now going to be asked about your personal property. Personal property means all of the things you own other than real property (real property is real estate such as a house, condo, or land). Personal property includes things like a mobile home, furniture, jewelry, household goods, and collectibles, as well as cash, stocks, and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). Do not include vehicles (such as cars, boats, trailers, motorcycles, or snowmobiles) in this section. Although vehicles are personal property, you will be asked about vehicles in the next section of this tool.

  - If you and your spouse agree about how all of your property and debt should be divided, use those terms throughout this part of the tool.
  - If you and your spouse don't agree about how your property and debt should be divided, complete this part of the tool using the division of property and debt terms that you want the judge to order.
  - If you and your spouse agree on how to divide some, but not all, of your property and debt, use the terms you do agree on, along with the terms that you want the judge to order for things you don't agree on.

  Normally the party who is awarded specific property, such as a car or home, is responsible for paying the debt related to that property. If you or your spouse need to sign any documents to make property transfers final, such as car title transfers or quitclaim deeds, your Judgment of Divorce will require you to do this within 30 days of when the judgment is final.

  ${marriage.debts.question}
subquestion: |
  The judge assigned to your divorce case will not have any authority over your creditors (those whom you owe money). Your Judgment of Divorce may divide your marital debt, assigning you or your spouse responsibility for paying each debt. However, creditors may continue to treat debts in both of your names as joint debt. If your spouse defaults on a debt that the Judgment of Divorce requires him or her to pay, you can return to the family court to seek repayment from him or her.

  It is important for all debts that are in both of your names to be included in your Judgment of Divorce. That way, if the person who your divorce assigns responsibility for paying the debt defaults, the other party has a remedy in family court.

subquestion: |
  Next you will be asked about vehicles. Vehicles include cars, boats, trailers, motorcycles, snowmobiles, and other motorized equipment titled to the owner. Mobile homes are vehicles, but do not include them here &mdash; you should have included mobile homes in the previous question about personal property.

  You will be asked for the Make and Model of each vehicle you own. Make refers to the name of the company that manufactured the vehicle. Examples of vehicle "makes" are Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, and Toyota. Model refers to the type of vehicle. Examples of "models" are Focus, Cutlass, Town and Country, and Highlander. If you are describing a vehicle other than a car, do your best to identify the vehicle using the Make and Model entries. For example, if you are listing a boat, you might say "Starcraft" for Make and "Starfish 226" for Model.

      <strong>In this tool, the person who is awarded a piece of real property (home, condo, or land) will also be made responsible for paying the mortgage, insurance, taxes, liens, and any other costs on the property. Or if you and the other party are going to sell the property and share equally in the profit or loss from the sale, both of you will be responsible for the mortgage, insurance, taxes, liens, and any other costs on the property until it is sold. These are common ways of assigning the rights and responsibilities of real property in a divorceâ€”but not the only ways. If you don't agree with any of these terms for dividing this real property and the related debt, you should consult with an attorney before finalizing your divorce. You may want to consider talking to a lawyer to assure you get the best possible outcome. Please review the articles Divorce Basics: Dividing Your Property and Debt and Real Estate and Divorce for more information on this topic.

      As part of the Judgment of Divorce, the person who is awarded the property may be ordered to refinance the home in his or her name alone. However, refinancing might not be possible if the property is worth less than the amount of the mortgage, if the person required to refinance has poor credit, or for other reasons.

      The person who is not awarded the property may be required to complete a quitclaim deed giving the other spouse his or her share of the property.</strong>
